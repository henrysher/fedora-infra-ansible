#
# setup a transient instance in the Fedora infrastructure private cloud
#
# This playbook is used to spin up a transient instance for someone to test something.
# In particular transient instances will all be terminated at least by the next
# maint window for the cloud, but ideally people will terminate instances they
# are done using.
#
# If you have an application or longer term item that should always be around
# please use the persistent playbook instead.
#
# You MUST pass a name to it, ie: -e 'name=somethingdescriptive'
# You can optionally override defaults by passing any of the following:
# image=imagename (default is centos70_x86_64)
# instance_type=some instance type (default is m1.small)
# root_auth_users='user1 user2 user3' (default is sysadmin-main group)
#
# Note: if you run this playbook with the same name= multiple times
# openstack is smart enough to just return the current ip of that instance
# and go on. This way you can re-run if you want to reconfigure it without
# reprovisioning it.
#
# Example command:
# transient_cloud_instance.yml --extra-vars="name='foo'  image='Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21.x86_64'"
#
