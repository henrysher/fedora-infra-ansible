# 1) mod_wsgi is configured to use the vars for its own setup
# 2) iptables opens enough ports for all threads for fedmsg

    The apache/mod_wsgi app is the only thing really running here

    This host relies on db01 for its database of activity (what module builds
    are in flight?)

    It has no special credentials itself.  When a module build it submitted, it
    makes a note in the DB and publishes a fedmsg message.  The mbs backend
    nodes do all the work of talking to koji.
