csi_relationship: |
    fedbadges integrates many different services..

    * The fedbadges fedmsg-hub plugin relies on:
      * the fedmsg bus, to deliver messages
      * pkgdb, for queries about who owns what packages
      * fas, to lookup what irc nick corresponds to what fas user.
      * db-datanommer for the fedmsg history
      * db01, for storing badge awards

    * badges-web01 will be expecting to display badges entered into the tahrir
      db on db01.  So, if badges stop showing up there, the problem is likely
      here.

    * Locally, of note there exists:
      * a git repo of badge rules and images to be synced here by ansible
        to /usr/share/badges/  
      * a local file cache in /var/tmp/fedbadges-cache.dbm (not memcached, atm)
      * Furthermore, there are a ton of cronjobs for awarding badges in
        /usr/share/badges/cronjobs/ that depends on all sorts of third parties
        (flickr, google+, libravatar, etc..).
