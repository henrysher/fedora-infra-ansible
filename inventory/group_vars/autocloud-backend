    This runs one of the two autocloud testing backends

    This host relies on:
    - A postgres db server running on db01.  The db is called 'autocloud'.
      The two autocloud-backend nodes populate that database with results.
    - fedmsg messages produced by koji indicating that new images were built.
    - queries to koji directly to download that content.

    Running locally we have:
    - fedmsg-hub which receives the initial notification from koji via fedmsg.
    - redis, which stores a work queue populated by fedmsg
    - the autocloud daemon, which pulls work from the redis queue and uses tunir
      to test images in vagrant.

    There's a cronjob that kills vagrant every 10 minutes if it got stuck on the
    last test.
