    The apache/mod_wsgi app is the only thing really running here.
    The mashing of repos is handled by the bodhi-backend node(s).

    * This host relies on:
      * db01 for its database.
      * it doesn't have a networked cache of its own.. but it keeps a local
        cache in /var/cache/bodhi/
      * taksotron (resultsdb) for getting status-check results (gating updates).

    * It also depends on these things, but we're trying to move them exclusively
      to the backend.
      * koji for tagging and untagging updates and listing candidate builds
      * bugzilla, for getting bug title information and for posting comments
        about status changes
      * the wiki for getting information about QA "Test Cases"

    * It provides a website that, on the client side depends on:
      * datagrepper queries to show the newfeed on the frontpage
      * the websocket server for popup notifications of others' activity.
      * the fedora-packages JSON api for suggesting package search results

    * Quite a few things rely on this webapp
      * Taskotron historically would comment on updates about the status of
        their checks.
      * Blockerbugs checks bodhi for lists of updates.
      * fedora-packages will try to query bodhi for the release status of
        updates.
      * fedora-easy-karma, abrt, 'fedpkg update', an eclipse plugin and other
        client tools make queries to the bodhi webapp here.
