    * This host relies on:
    - the virthost it's hosted on (virthost17.phx2.fedoraproject.org)
    - FAS to authenticate users
    - VPN connectivity

    * Things that rely on this host:
    - Infrastructure team to be awair of the infra status. operations control process will fail
    - if this host is down, it will be difficult to know the status of infra and provide reactive/proactive support
    - if this host is down, dhcp/bootp leases/renew will fail. pxe booting will fail as well
