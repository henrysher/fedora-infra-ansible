    This host handles all of the bodhi backend stuff **except** for mashing.
    https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/blob/develop/bodhi/consumers/

    * This host relies on:
      * db01 for its database, which is shares with the bodhi2 frontend nodes.
      * The fedmsg bus for triggering work.
      * XMLRPC calls to koji for tagging and untagging updates.
      * bugzilla for posting comments about status changes
      * the wiki for getting information about QA "Test Cases"

    * No other systems rely directly on this host.  Everything depends on it
      indirectly for the creation of new updates repos (which get synced out to
      the master mirror for distribution.
