## Primary architechures by release
##
## {release}_{version}_primary_arches: Releases that have alternative arches must define their
##      primary arches here. Any arches found during mashing that are not present here are asssumed
##      to be alternative arches. This is used during the wait_for_repo() step of the mash where
##      Bodhi polls the master repo to find out whether the mash has made it to the repo or not.
##      Bodhi looks for primary arches with the {release}_{request}_master_repomd setting above, and
##      for alternative arches at the {release}_{request}_alt_master_repomd setting above. If this
##      is not set, Bodhi will assume the release only has primary arches.
