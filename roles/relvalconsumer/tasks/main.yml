# This role creates Wikitcms release validation events. There should
# always be exactly one host in infra with this role set up and
# relvalconsumer_prod set to True, or else we'll stop getting events.
#
# Required vars
# - wikitcms_token
##      string - a token file to install for unattended wiki editing
#                using openidc auth
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_queue
##      string - Message queue name for the consumer. To use the
##               fedora-messaging scheduler with public authentication
##               on the Fedora production AMQP broker (which is what
##               you'd typically want), you only need to set this.
##               This should be a unique and private string; the
##               official recommendation is to use a random UUID
##               generated by uuidgen.
#
# Required vars with defaults
# - relvalconsumer_prod
##       bool - whether this is the production instance. **SHOULD ONLY
##              EVER BE TRUE ON ONE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD**
##       default - False
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_passive
##        bool - If true, passive_declares will be set true in all the
##               fedora-messaging consumer configuration files. This
##               is needed for private authentication on the Fedora
##               brokers.
##       default - False
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_url
##      string - AMQP broker URL for fedora-messaging job scheduler.
##               The role default for this is the Fedora production
##               broker with the shared 'fedora' username.
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_cacert
##      string - CA certificate file to use for authenticating with
##               AMQP broker for fedora-messaging job scheduler.
##               The role default for this is the CA cert file for the
##               Fedora production broker.
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_cert
##      string - Certificate file to use for authenticating with AMQP
##               broker for fedora-messaging job scheduler. The role
##               default for this is the certificate file for the
##               public 'fedora' account on the Fedora production
##               broker.
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_key
##      string - Private key file to use for authenticating with AMQP
##               broker for fedora-messaging job scheduler. The role
##               default for this is the key file for the public
##               'fedora' account on the Fedora production broker.
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_routing_keys
##        list - List of routing key names for the fedora-messaging
##               scheduler to subscribe to. The role default for this
##               is the appropriate keys for the Fedora production
##               broker.
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_mailfrom
##      string - From email address for error report emails. Defaults
##               to "root@{{ external_hostname }}". Only relevant if
##               relvalconsumer_amqp_mailto is set.
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_smtp
##      string - Hostname of SMTP server to use for sending error
##               emails. Defaults to 'localhost'. Only relevant if
##               relvalconsumer_amqp_mailto is set.
#
# Optional vars
# - relvalconsumer_amqp_mailto
##        list - List of email addresses to email errors to. If set,
##               the email log handler will be configured.
# - relvalconsumer_bugzilla_api_key
##        string - An API key for Bugzilla. If relvalconsumer_prod and
##                 this are both set, the consumer will be configured
##                 to report bugs to Bugzilla for oversize images. As
##                 with relvalconsumer_prod, only the 'official' prod
##                 instance should have this set.
