# Most of the following options need only be specified once. If
# they appear more than once, then the last one seen will be used.
# Some options are allowed to appear more than once, and the text
# describing the option will say if this is so.
#

#
# If this option is set to 1, it specifies that the mirrors file, which
# is used when the '--update' and '--versioncheck' options are used, is
# to be rotated. Rotating the entries in the file allows a basic form
# of load-balancing between the mirror sites whenever the above options
# are used.
# If the option is set to 0, then the mirrors will be treated as if in
# a priority list. That is, the first mirror will always be used. The
# second mirror will only be used if the first mirror fails, then the
# third mirror will be used if the second fails and so on.
#

ROTATE_MIRRORS=1

#
# If this option is set to 1, it specifies that when the '--update'
# option is used, then the mirrors file is to be checked for updates
# as well. If the current mirrors file contains any local mirrors,
# these will be prepended to the updated file.
# If this option is set to 0, the mirrors file can only be updated
# manually. This may be useful if only using local mirrors.
#
UPDATE_MIRRORS=1

#
# The MIRRORS_MODE option tells rkhunter which mirrors are to be
# used when the '--update' or '--versioncheck' command-line options
# are given. Possible values are:
#     0 - use any mirror (the default)
#     1 - only use local mirrors
#     2 - only use remote mirrors
#
# Local and remote mirrors can be defined in the mirrors.dat file
# by using the 'local=' and 'remote=' keywords respectively.
#
MIRRORS_MODE=0

# Email a message to this address if a warning is found when the
# system is being checked. Multiple addresses may be specified

#
# Set the following option to enable the rkhunter check start and finish
# times to be logged by syslog. Warning messages will also be logged.
# The value of the option must be a standard syslog facility and
# priority, separated by a dot.
#
# For example: USE_SYSLOG=authpriv.warning
#
# Setting the value to 'none', or just leaving the option commented out,
# disables the use of syslog.
#
USE_SYSLOG=authpriv.notice

# Set the following option to 1 if the second colour set is to be used.
# This can be useful if your screen uses black characters on a white

#
COLOR_SET2=0

# The following option is checked against the SSH configuration file
# 'PermitRootLogin' option. A warning will be displayed if they do not

# This option has a default value of 'no'.
#
ALLOW_SSH_ROOT_USER=without-password

#
# Set this option to '1' to allow the use of the SSH-1 protocol, but note
# that theoretically it is weaker, and therefore less secure, than the
# SSH-2 protocol. Do not modify this option unless you have good reasons
# to use the SSH-1 protocol (for instance for AFS token passing or Kerberos4
# authentication). If the 'Protocol' option has not been set in the SSH
# configuration file, then a value of '2' may be set here in order to
# suppress a warning message. This option has a default value of '0'.

# These two options determine which tests are to be performed.
# The ENABLE_TESTS option can use the word 'all' to refer to all the
# available tests. The DISABLE_TESTS option can use the word 'none' to
# mean that no tests are disabled. The list of disabled tests is applied to
# the list of enabled tests. Both options are space-separated lists of test
# names. The currently available test names can be seen by using the command
# 'rkhunter --list tests'.
#
# The program defaults are to enable all tests and disable none. However, if
# either option is specified in this file, then it overrides the program
# default. The supplied rkhunter.conf file has some tests already disabled,
# and these are tests that will be used only incidentally, can be considered
# "advanced" or those that are prone to produce more than the "average" number
# of "false positives".
#
# Please read the README file for more details about enabling and disabling
# tests, the test names, and how rkhunter behaves when these options are used.

{% endif %}

#
# The HASH_FUNC option can be used to specify the command to use
# for the file hash value check. It can be specified as just
# the command name or the full pathname. Systems using prelinking
# are restricted to using either SHA1 or MD5 functions. To get rkhunter
# to look for the sha1(sum)/md5(sum) command, or to use the supplied
# perl scripts, simply specify this option as 'SHA1' or 'MD5' in
# uppercase. The default is SHA1, or MD5 if SHA1 cannot be found.
#
# A value of 'NONE' (in uppercase) can be specified to indicate that
# no hash function should be used. Rootkit Hunter will detect this and
# automatically disable the file hash checks.
#
# Examples:
#   For Solaris 9 : HASH_FUNC=gmd5sum
#   For Solaris 10: HASH_FUNC=sha1sum
#   For AIX (>5.2): HASH_FUNC="csum -hMD5"
#   For NetBSD    : HASH_FUNC="cksum -a sha512"
#
# NOTE: If the hash function is changed then you MUST run rkhunter with
#       the '--propupd' option to rebuild the file properties database.
#
HASH_FUNC=sha1sum

#
# The HASH_FLD_IDX option specifies which field from the HASH_FUNC
# command output contains the hash value. The fields are assumed to
# be space-separated. The default value is one, but for *BSD users
# rkhunter will, by default, use a value of 4 if the HASH_FUNC option
# has not been set. The option value must be a positive integer.
#
#HASH_FLD_IDX=4

#
# The PKGMGR option tells rkhunter to use the specified package manager
# to obtain the file property information. This is used when updating
# the file properties file 'rkhunter.dat', and when running the file
# properties check. For RedHat/RPM-based systems, 'RPM' can be used
# to get information from the RPM database. For Debian-based systems
# 'DPKG' can be used, and for *BSD systems 'BSD' can be used.
# No value, or a value of 'NONE', indicates that no package manager
# is to be used. The default is 'NONE'.
#
# The current package managers store the file hash values using an
# MD5 hash function.
#
# The 'DPKG' and 'BSD' package managers only provide MD5 hash values.
# The 'RPM' package manager additionally provides values for the inode,
# file permissions, uid, gid and other values.
#
# For any file not part of a package, rkhunter will revert to using
# the HASH_FUNC hash function instead.
#
PKGMGR=RPM

# The following option can be used to whitelist network ports which
# are known to have been used by malware. The option is a space-
# separated list of one or more of three types of whitelisting.
# These are:
#
#   1) a 'protocol:port' pair       (e.g. TCP:25)
#   2) a pathname to an executable  (e.g. /usr/sbin/squid)
#   3) an asterisk ('*')
#
# Only the UDP or TCP protocol may be specified, and the port number
# must be between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
#
# The asterisk can be used to indicate that any executable in a trusted
# path directory will be whitelisted. A trusted path directory is one which
# rkhunter uses to locate commands. It is composed of the root PATH
# environment variable, and the BINDIR command-line or configuration
# file option.
#
# For example: PORT_WHITELIST="/home/user1/abc /opt/xyz TCP:2001 UDP:32011"
#
#PORT_WHITELIST=""

#
# The following option can be used to tell rkhunter where the operating
# system 'release' file is located. This file contains information
# specifying the current O/S version. RKH will store this information
# itself, and check to see if it has changed between each run. If it has
# changed, then the user is warned that RKH may issue warning messages
# until RKH has been run with the '--propupd' option.
#
# Since the contents of the file vary according to the O/S distribution,
# RKH will perform different actions when it detects the file itself. As
# such, this option should not be set unless necessary. If this option is
# specified, then RKH will assume the O/S release information is on the
# first non-blank line of the file.
