You are receiving this email because there's a problem with your
bugzilla.redhat.com account.

If you recently changed the email address associated with your
Fedora account in the Fedora Account System, it is now out of sync
with your bugzilla.redhat.com account. This leads to problems
with Fedora packages you own or are CC'ed on bug reports for.

Please take one of the following actions:

a) login to your old bugzilla.redhat.com account and change the email
address to match your current email in the Fedora account system.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com login, click preferences, account
information and enter new email address.

b) Create a new account in bugzilla.redhat.com to match your
email listed in your Fedora account system account.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/ click 'new account' and enter email
address.

c) Change your Fedora Account System email to match your existing
bugzilla.redhat.com account.
https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts login, click on 'my account',
then 'edit' and change your email address.

If you have questions or concerns, please let us know.

Your prompt attention in this matter is appreciated.

The Fedora admins.
