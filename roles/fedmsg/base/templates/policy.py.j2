        # There is another option that we do not set.  If `routing_nitpicky` is
        # set to True, then a given message's topic *must* appear in this list
        # in order for it to pass validation.  For instance, we have
        # routing_nitpicky set to False by default and no
        # "org.fedoraproject.prod.logger.log" topics appear in this policy,
        # therefore, any message bearing that topic and *any* certificate signed
        # by our CA may pass validation.
